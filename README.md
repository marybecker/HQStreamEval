# High Quality Stream Evaluation Framework

## Proposed Project Abstract

Significant progress has been made to clean up rivers since the passage of the 1972 Federal Water Pollution and Control Act amendments, more commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, fifty years ago. However, since that time much of the focus has been on restoring waste-receiving streams with overt pollution problems which has left high quality streams vulnerable and open to degradation.  High quality streams support aquatic species not found in streams with higher levels of pollution ([Bellucci et al 2011](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DEEP/water/water_quality_management/monitoringpubs/Bellucci-et-al-2011-Northeastern-Naturalist.pdf)) along with a wide array of critical ecosystem services that benefit the social and economic well-being of humans ([EPA 2012](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-10/documents/economic_benefits_factsheet3.pdf)).  Preliminary work conducted in Connecticut suggests the possible reduction of species sensitive to pollution in some high quality streams sampling sites monitored over the the past 30 years ([Eltz & Beauchene 2020](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DEEP/fishing/fisheries_management/Trout-Research-and-Management/Probabilistic-Sampling-of-Wild-Brook-Trout-Occurrence-in-Stream-Survey-Samples-Final-05082020.pdf), [Becker 2021a](https://marybecker.github.io/Biointegrity/), [Becker & Bellucci 2021](https://marybecker.github.io/BioVariability/)). 
This project will seek to develop and effectively communicate modernized landscape level assessment methods that continue to augment the success of the Clean Water Act in the State of Connecticut.  Using existing biological and land cover datasets I will develop methods to identify high quality streams.  I also plan to identify those high quality streams that are most vulnerable to degradation.  This information could be used by aquatic resource managers and decision makers to prioritize preservation efforts, as well as support management to prevent further degradation in these streams and implement anti-degradation measures under the Clean Water Act.  

I propose that an interactive web-mapping application would be the best way to convey data on high quality streams and drainage systems to decision makers.  The application would allow for a simplified high level overview of statewide conditions, while still allowing the user to dig deeper into the site and watershed scale data through leveled zoom and click functions with popup information, as well as the potential for coordinated visualizations between the mapped features and data plots.
