## Introduction

Biological integrity is the ability of an aquatic ecosystem to support and maintain a balanced, adaptive community of organisms having a species composition, diversity, and functional organization comparable to that of natural habitats within a region. The presence, condition, numbers and types of fish, insects, algae, plants, and other organisms provide direct, accurate information about the health of water bodies. Biological assessments measure these factors and are the primary tool used to evaluate the condition of water bodies. Because biological communities are affected by all of the stressors to which they are exposed over time, bioassessments provide information on disturbances not always revealed by water chemistry or other measurements.

The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) samples several aquatic biological communities, including benthic macro-invertebrates.   Benthic macro-invertebrates are animals without backbones, who inhabit the bottom of rivers and streams, as well as many other waterbody types. These organisms are very well studied and have a long history of use as indicators of water quality. Certain types, including mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies, can survive only in the cleanest water quality conditions. Other major groups of macro-invertebrates are true flies, beetles, worms, crustaceans, and dragonflies. Tolerant species are those that can live in highly polluted waters, moderate species can endure a moderate level of pollution, while sensitive species only occur in waters with little to no pollution. Macro-invertebrate community data is interpreted into attributes and metrics that describe the biological condition of the stream.

The Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) is a scientific framework to interpret biological responses to anthropogenic stress (Davies & Jackson, 2006).  The BCG framework provides a way to designate refined aquatic life uses along a gradient of stress.  This allows for a more precise measure of biological condition rather than a ‘pass’/’fail’ system that has been previously used for biological assessment(ref - CALM).  There are 6 levels of biological condition described by the framework (Figure 1).  The levels are described in terms of changes in the structure and function of native aquatic communities. The levels range from a natural pristine condition with little anthropogenic stress (Level 1) to a severely stressed and altered condition that exhibits extreme changes in structure and ecosystem function (Level 6).

The BCG is calibrated for benthic macro-invertebrate community data in Connecticut high gradient streams (Gerritsen & Jessup, 2007).  The Connecticut BCG model includes decision criteria to assign macro-invertebrate stream samples to levels of the BCG.  

## Methodology

*Sample Collection*

The analysis includes macro-invertebrate samples collected in high gradient streams in Connecticut from 1989 to 2020.  Samples are collected during the fall benthic community index period (September 15 - November 30) using a consistent collection method which follows the EPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocol III (RBP III) for Stream and Rivers (Plafkin, 1989).  RBP III involves collecting 12 kick samples (stops) throughout riffles at sampling sites using a rectangular net (18"x18"x10") with 800 × 900 μm mesh. The stops are spread out as best as possible both up, down, and across the riffle. The resulting sample is meant to represent the community as a whole within the riffle. The contents from all 12 stops are composited into sample containers and preserved in the field with 70% ethyl alcohol. Identification is to the lowest practical taxa based on an approximately 200-organism sub-sample.

*High Quality Stream Selection*

Macroinvertebrate samples identified as a BCG 1 or 2 were considered high quality streams.
Upstream watershed drainage catchments and flow were identified using Catchments and Flowline derived from the National Hydrography Dataset. Upstream BCG2 drainages preprocessed in QGIS 3.4 using the [Flow Trace Tool](https://github.com/boesiii/flowtrace)
